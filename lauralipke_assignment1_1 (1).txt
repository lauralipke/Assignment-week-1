My name is Laura Lipke. I am an MLIS student at the University of Maryland, College Park. This is my final semester and I hope to graduate this August. 
My career interests are to work in a university academic library as a Research and Instruction librarian
I am an avid reader and love historical fiction especially about any era between Reconstruction and WWII. 
I am originally from Syracuse, NY, but I now live in Baltimore with my boyfriend, 2 cats and a dog named Cole. 
My favorite foods are anything grilled, anything with peanut butter and chocolate and ice cream. I am also a coffee junky and drink it much too often!
I love to travel, especially to state parks and to search for unusual antiques. 
My hope is that with the skills I develop in this class that I will expand upon them in the future in order to improve the accessibility of library websites for students with disabilities.
